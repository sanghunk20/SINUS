"""End-to-end report generation: one CBCT volume -> one English radiology report.

This is the inference path, driven by `toothfairy.cli.report`. There is no ground truth and no
feature cache here, so the perception features are extracted from the volume **on the fly**:

  1. **dental segmentation network** (frozen), one pass -> non-teeth and arch region features
     (LPS -> RAS flip).
  2. **tf2 (ToothFairy2_Teeth) segmentation network** (frozen), one pass -> per-tooth density
     features (RAS -> flip).
     - hybrid + argmax: whole pooling.
     - hybrid + density: soft pooling plus lo/hi/sat sub-pools.
  3. **hybrid encoding** -> findings head -> per-structure decode. Each anatomical token
     (38 = 4 non-teeth + 2 arch summaries + 32 FDI teeth) is generated separately with the EOS
     gate self-gating (a normal slot produces an empty output) -> bullets concatenated in a
     fixed order.
  4. **Narrative rewrite**: a rewrite-only LoRA is stacked on the same 4-bit base model and
     moves the 36 slots into prose (the report LoRA stays loaded; only the active adapter is
     swapped). If that fails the concatenated bullets are emitted, so a report always comes out.

WARNING: dental and tf2 use different left/right flip conventions (dental flips LPS volumes,
   tf2 flips RAS volumes) -> each backbone gets its own preparation step
   (tf2_tooth_density.prepare_tf2_volume and _dental_ras in this file).
